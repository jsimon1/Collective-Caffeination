        <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our first group project meeting, nearly all of us came with some form of caffeinated beverage in hand, so creating a web application that makes it easier for students to meet over a cup of coffee seemed like something that many RPI students would enjoy and could relate to.</br>
        </br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We knew we wanted to make something to help students at RPI who would not ordinarily meet, get a chance to go outside of their comfort zone and make friends on campus.</p>
